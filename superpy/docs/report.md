# Report

> _Please include a short,
300-word report that highlights three technical elements of your implementation that you find notable,
explain what problem they solve and why you chose to implement it in this way.
Include this in your repository as a report.md file._

## 1. Rich Module

The Rich Table implementation in this cli tool is (what I find) a very handy addition that gives the cli UI a readable presentation after issuing a command. The presentation of every, specified or requested, data is shown in a readable table.

## 2. Classes and Pytest

The tests I wrote, were written with a pass at the beginning of the assignment. Afterwards it turned out that my tests were not written correctly at all. I had to adjust and fix this at a later stage of the assignment, because it is one of the requirements of this assignment.

I implemented inventory class, so I can create some functions which overwrite the csv data without affecting the original csv data. Only for running tests with pytest, because I had to rewrite them afterwards and implement them with my already written code for this assignment. Because of creating an inventory class it is more accessible and easy to implement and running the tests with pytest.

It may not be the neatest way of writing code or solving this problem, but I'm glad and proud that this is now working and resolved. It also taught me how important it is to write (and understand) good tests at the beginning of a project or an assignment. I have to work on this.

## 3. User Manual

Maybe an undervalued technical element, but something I'm proud of is the User Manual I wrote for this cli tool. Perhaps more important than the application itself is (what I find) the user manual of any application. The user manual provides an accessible explanation of the application, which makes it user-friendly. I hope I have managed to write the user manual in such a way that everyone understands and can use the application properly.
